# About

This project is based on the card game, War. 

Both players begin with a full shuffled deck of cards.  Then each player will take turns flipping the cards until one of decks is empty.  The player left with the cards wins the game. 
 
This is the first project in which we instructed to use an API.  I use the Deck Of Cards API which can be found at http://deckofcardsapi.com/. 

This was an individual project at Nashville Software School.
